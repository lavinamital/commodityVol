    "text": "1 Introduction\nGlobal markets are deeply shaped by major geopolitical events, yet each asset often responds in a very different way given that each asset contributes something different to the global marketplace. I chose to study crude oil, gold, and natural gas because these commodities play central roles in the global economy and are especially sensitive to political and economic shocks. For example, bonds are not assets that are particularly effected by geopolitical relationships and are not very sensitive. Equities too are not the most effected. My goal was to explore how each commodity that I’ve chosen behaves in the timeline of major crises. I wanted to understand whether or not these reactions reveal meaningful patterns about market risk and co-movement (how assets move together). I chose crude oil, gold, and natural gas because these are the most traded (by volume) and also the most globally valuable assets to all economies, regardless of climate. By examining price levels, returns, volatility patterns, and event-window behavior, my project provides accessible insight into how these commodities react when global uncertainty spikes.",

    "text": "2.1 Description (2.1)\nFor this project I use daily futures data for three major commodities: gold (GC=F), WTI crude oil (CL=F), and natural gas (NG=F). The data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the tq_get() function in tidyquant package, which provides access to Yahoo’s historical price data. I pulled data from Jan 1, 2014 to now so I could capture several years of “normal” market behavior as well as the periods around the three major global events I analyze later (COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and the Israel–Hamas escalation). For each commodity, the raw data set includes the daily open, high, low, and close prices, the adjusted closing price (which I rename to price and base my analysis on). I used the adjusted price because it pulls together the different futures contracts over time, creating a smooth and consistent time series. The data set also contains daily trading volume. I construct two additional variables: a simple daily return, defined as price / lag(price) − 1, which captures the day-to-day percentage change in price, and a log return, log(price / lag(price)), which is easier to work with over longer horizons because log returns add up cleanly across days and treat up and down moves more symmetrically. The raw data used in this chapter are stored in the repository at data/raw/commodities_raw.rds and were generated by the script scripts/pull_commodities.R, which documents the exact download parameters.",

The only other variable with any missingness is volume, and even there the total number of missing entries is very small. All of the price-related variables (price, open, high, low, close) have essentially no missing values, which suggests the underlying futures data from Yahoo Finance is very complete. This makes sense since Yahoo Finance is a very reputed and well documented source to pull data from.\n\n\nCode\n#| label: missing-over-time\n#| fig.cap: \"Missing price and volume values over time.\"\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false\n\n# 1.

There are just a few isolated dates with missing volume and no dates at all with missing prices. These gaps are likely due to occasional exchange holidays or incomplete reporting rather than a systematic issue. Because they are so sparse, I can safely drop those rows or ignore them in later plots without affecting the overall patterns.\n\n\nCode\nmissing_heat &lt;- commod_raw |&gt;\n  mutate(across(-c(date, ticker), ~ is.na(.x))) |&gt;\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(\n    cols = -c(date, ticker),\n    names_to = \"variable\",\n    values_to = \"is_missing\"\n  )\n\nmissing_heat_zoom &lt;- missing_heat |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(is_missing)\n\nggplot(missing_heat_zoom,\n       aes(x = date, y = variable, fill = is_missing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"white\", \"TRUE\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Missing value heatmap, zoomed into missing days\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Variable\",\n    fill = \"Missing?\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap makes the missingness pattern even more apparent. The thin red stripes for ret_simple and ret_log at the start of the sample correspond to the first day for each ticker, where returns are undefined by construction. A few additional red tiles for volume line up with the isolated missing days seen in the time-series plot. The absence of red tiles for the price variables again indicates that price data are fully observed. Overall, the missing values are rare, localized, and do not require any special treatment beyond ignoring the first return for each series.",

    "text": "3.1 Non technical summary:\nIndexing the three commodities to 100 in 2014 allows us to compare their movements on the same scale since the true market values for each of these assets varies significantly based on value and demand in the global marketplace. Gold shows the most consistent upward trend, with sharp increases during periods of global uncertainty such as 2020 and 2024–2025. This is why Gold is thought to always be the most safe and stable investment, no matter the economic climate. Crude oil displays large event-driven swings, most notably the collapse during the beginning of 2020 and volatility around the beginning of the Russian-Ukraine war. Natural gas is the most volatile overall, with many spikes and crashes tied to supply disruptions and seasonal demand. Overall, Gold behaves like a steady “safe-haven” asset, while oil and natural gas react more dramatically to geopolitical shocks.\nThe distribution of daily log returns differs across commodities. Gold has the sharpest and narrowest peak centered at zero. This reflects the role of gold as a low-volatility safe-haven asset, as discussed earlier. Crude oil and natural gas show wider distributions, indicating more day-to-day price variability. Natural gas has the thickest tails, consistent with its tendency toward extreme price swings because of many small events. Overall, these distributions highlight that the three commodities respond very differently to global events, like the graph above emphasized as well. Using log returns ensures my comparisons are fair; I use this method repeatedly in the following graphs.\nThe boxplots highlight clear differences in volatility across the three commodities. Gold shows a very tight distribution with minimal outliers, reflecting its stable, low-vol behavior. Crude oil displays moderate dispersion with occasional large moves tied to geopolitical shocks and shifts in global demand. Natural gas shows the widest spread and the most extreme outliers, emphasizing sensitivity to abrupt price swings.\nThe 30-day rolling volatility plot shows clear spikes in commodity risk during major global events. Natural gas exhibits the highest and most frequent volatility surges. Oil shows sharp but less persistent volatility spikes, particularly during the COVID-19 shock and the early phase of the Russia–Ukraine conflict. Gold remains the most stable of the three commodities, with limited volatility changes even during large global shocks. These patterns highlight that not all commodities react equally to global crises, and volatility can reveal more about market stress than when we just look at prices alone.\nThe rolling 90-day correlations show how tightly linked these commodity markets are over time, though it is a little hard to see in the line graph format. The Oil–Natural Gas pair typically has the strongest and most consistently positive correlation, reflecting their shared exposure to changes in global energy demand. Correlations involving Gold are generally lower and more unstable, which fits the idea that gold behaves differently from energy markets. Around major events highlighted earlier, correlations shift noticeably, suggesting that crises can briefly pull markets together (co-movement) or push them apart depending on the nature of the shock.\nThis heatmap provides a higher-level view of how correlation relationships between commodities evolve over time by aggregating the 90-day rolling correlations into monthly averages. While the earlier line graph showed noisy day-to-day fluctuations, this visualization shows more stable structural patterns, such as Oil–Gold correlations frequently turning positive during volatile periods (light purple) and Gold–Natural Gas occasionally going negative (light red) during commodity-specific shocks.\nAbnormal volatility patterns differ sharply across global shocks, and each commodity responds in ways consistent with its economic role. During the COVID-19 declaration, oil experiences an extreme surge in volatility as demand collapsed and supply uncertainty grew, while gold and natural gas show only moderate increases. The Israel–Hamas escalation produces a much smaller and more contained market reaction (only goes to about 0.01 compared to 0.075 for COVID 19), with some volatility spike in oil and gold. The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggers the largest natural gas volatility spike in the sample, reflecting Europe’s dependence on Russian supply, alongside a notable jump in oil volatility. Overall, different events activate different market channels, telling us how commodity specific fundamentals shape volatility responses.\nThese graphs track cumulative returns over a 120-day window around each crisis (60 days before, 60 days after). Gold tends to drift upward during each event, consistent with its position as a safe-haven asset. Oil and natural gas show much sharper swings: there is a sell off around COVID and Israel-Hamas escalation, but rally after Russian invasion of Ukraine. Together with the volatility plots above, this graph proves that crises do not just increase risk/change stability; they reprice commodities in different directions, with natural gas and oil reacting most strongly to these sudden shifts.\nThe analysis above shows that crude oil, gold, and natural gas behave very differently over time and respond differently to major global events. Gold is the most stable, oil shows moderate swings, and natural gas is the most volatile. During crises volatility will generally spike sharply for natural gas and oil, while gold remains steady, increasing modestly after the event in question. We also found a relationship between commodities: oil and natural gas often move together, while gold act independently (and pretty much appreciates in value no matter what). It is additionally important to note that the nature of the crisis will also play a role in how the assets move long term, while the initial reactions can be repetitive. Overall, the results reveal clear differences in each commodity’s risk profile and how strongly each reacts to global shocks.",

    "text": "Overall, the analysis reveals clear differences in how crude oil, gold, and natural gas respond to major global shocks. Natural gas consistently shows the sharpest volatility spikes, oil exhibits moderate but noticeable reactions, and gold remains relatively stable. Correlation patterns also shift during crises, with oil and natural gas often moving together while gold behaves more independently. These findings highlight that each commodity carries a distinct risk profile and reacts differently to geopolitical stress, as each commodity provides something different to the global marketplace. My analysis here is limited by relying only on historical price data and a small set of events. If I were to expand the scope of the project and use macroeconomic indicators (CPI, treasury yields, currency exchange rates, etc) or additional commodities (like other metals), I could provide deeper insight. Down the line, it would be interesting to expand the scope of the project to consider the aforementioned macro indicators, and involve ML based techniques like clustering or predictive modeling. I would use clustering to group crisis periods and use predictive modeling to create a sensitivity plan of these assets when the time for another crisis comes.Through this project, I learned how powerful exploratory visualization can be for uncovering hidden market dynamics and telling a clear, data-driven story while balancing many input considerations.",
