# Introduction

Global markets are deeply shaped by major geopolitical events, yet each asset often responds in a very different way given that each asset contributes something different to the global marketplace. I chose to study crude oil, gold, and natural gas because these commodities play central roles in the global economy and are especially sensitive to political and economic shocks. For example, bonds are not assets that are particularly effected by geopolitical relationships and are not very sensitive. Equities too are not the most effected. My goal was to explore how each commodity that I've chosen behaves in the timeline of major crises. I wanted to understand whether or not these reactions reveal meaningful patterns about market risk and co-movement (how assets move together). I chose crude oil, gold, and natural gas because these are the most traded (by volume) and also the most globally valuable assets to all economies, regardless of climate. By examining price levels, returns, volatility patterns, and event-window behavior, my project provides accessible insight into how these commodities react when global uncertainty spikes.
