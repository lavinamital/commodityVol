# Conclusion

Overall, the analysis reveals clear differences in how crude oil, gold, and natural gas respond to major global shocks. Natural gas consistently shows the sharpest volatility spikes, oil exhibits moderate but noticeable reactions, and gold remains relatively stable. Correlation patterns also shift during crises, with oil and natural gas often moving together while gold behaves more independently. These findings highlight that each commodity carries a distinct risk profile and reacts differently to geopolitical stress, as each commodity provides something different to the global marketplace. My analysis here is limited by relying only on historical price data and a small set of events. If I were to expand the scope of the project and use  macroeconomic indicators (CPI, treasury yields, currency exchange rates, etc) or additional commodities (like other metals), I could provide deeper insight. Down the line, it would be interesting to expand the scope of the project to consider the aforementioned macro indicators, and involve ML based techniques like clustering or predictive modeling. I would use clustering to group crisis periods and use predictive modeling to create a sensitivity plan of these assets when the time for another crisis comes.Through this project, I learned how powerful exploratory visualization can be for uncovering hidden market dynamics and telling a clear, data-driven story while balancing many input considerations.
